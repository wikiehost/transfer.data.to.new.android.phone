When it's time to switch from your older Android phone to a new one, you'll want to make sure all of your data makes its way across safely. Thankfully, Google makes it extremely convenient to migrate your texts, call logs, contacts, music, and photos over to your new phone seamlessly.


You've unboxed your new phone and are ready to set it up. There are a few ways to restore data from your older device, and here I'm highlighting the option that has worked best for me over the years (I switch phones once every two weeks, so I know what I'm talking about). 

You'll need your old phone for this, so make sure you don't reset the data just yet. At this point, you should switch the SIM card over to the new phone. Let's get started.

1. Select your device language and hit Start on the welcome page.

2. Select your home Wi-Fi network and sign in.

3. Hit Next at the Copy apps & data screen to begin migrating data from your old phone.

4. Insert a USB-C to USB-C cable into your old phone and tap Next on your new phone.

5. Now, plug in the other Type-C connector into your new phone.

6. Hit Next once again here.

From there, you just select everything that you'd like to migrate from your old phone to your new one and follow the instructions. Android has become so intuitive that it even logs into your Google account and transfers all your saved Wi-Fi passwords. Because this is a direct data transfer method, you won't need to enter two-factor authentication or any of that jazz.

That's all there is to it. Once setup is finished and you get to the home screen, you'll see the Play Store running in the background and restoring data from your old phone. This can take up to an hour based on the amount of content installed on your old phone and your internet connection, so you can let that run while configuring the rest of the settings on your new phone.

In the event that something does not copy properly, you can restore your files and data from your cloud backups. However, this method usually works incredibly smoothly.
